*Main documentation on [Read the Docs](https://storyboard.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html).*

`storyboard` is a customizable video storyboard generator with metadata reporting directly embedded in the generated images, based on [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/). Reported metadata fields include, but are not limited to, title, filename, file size, SHA-1 digest, container format, duration, pixel dimension, display aspect ratio (DAR), scan type (progressive, interlaced, or telecined), frame rate, and per-stream metadata (type, codec, profile, dimensions, bitrate, etc.). See the samples below to get a feel for `storyboard`'s capabilities.

## Background

`storyboard` was inspired by the storyboards I frequently see on video-sharing Internet forums, mostly generated by proprietary video players. Those storyboards come with video/file metadata bundled, which is a great all-in-one solution for video sharing, saving one the labor of typing multiple console commands, copying and pasting output, and worrying about the forum's crappy formatting. However, I, for one, dislike proprietary players. Also, those storyboards are usually ugly and uninformative, using stupid fonts and lacking crucial information that hackers look for (e.g., hash). Therefore, here I present a customizable storyboard generator for hackers.

## Installation and dependencies

*Main article on [Read the Docs](https://storyboard.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html).* Below is a brief summary.

### Dependencies

* [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/). Check the [official downloads page](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) for installation options. On OS X you may install FFmpeg via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) or [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/). The former is recommended.

* [Pillow](https://python-pillow.github.io/). This dependency will be picked up by `pip` when you install `storyboard`, but you also have to satisfy the external dependencies, especially `libjpeg` and `libfreetype`. See [the official installation guide](https://pillow.readthedocs.org/installation.html) for details. (Satisfying external dependencies is very important on Linux, where no wheel distribution is provided on PyPI.)

### Installation

```
pip install storyboard
```

## Command-line usage

*Main article on [Read the Docs](https://storyboard.readthedocs.org/en/latest/cli.html).* Below is a brief summary.

This package installs two console scripts, `metadata` and `storyboard`. You may find documentation of both using the `-h,--help` option. Extensive documentation is also available:

* [`metadata` CLI reference](https://storyboard.readthedocs.org/en/latest/metadata-cli.html);
* [`storyboard` CLI reference](https://storyboard.readthedocs.org/en/latest/storyboard-cli.html).

By the way, the default invocation is really simple (for both): just supply one or more video paths.

## Issues

### Reporting

Please report issues or browse a list of known issues at <https://github.com/zmwangx/storyboard/issues>. See "Known issues" for instructions on how to report issues related to an unknown codec.

### Known issues

* `storyboard` uses `PIL.ImageFont` from Pillow to draw text, which is rather primitive and only allows one font at a time (no fallback). The default font packaged is Source Code Pro Regular, which only draws its supported code points, and leave unknown code points as boxes. In particular, there is no CJK support, so CJK characters in video filenames won't come out very nice.

    You can specify your own font file that covers (part of) CJK code points, but the catch is that you should really use fixed-width fonts (unless you want to blow up the beautiful formatting, in which case you might as well use a proprietary player to generate a storyboard that's bad-looking inside out). It's basically impossible to have a truly fixed-width font that mixes CJK glyphs with Latin glyths, since they are so different — CJK glyphs are intrinsically square-shaped. This is just a sad fact of life and there's nothing we can do about it. Therefore, **there's no CJK support in `storyboard`** (CJK characters won't break `storyboard` — they just come out as boxes). Hopefully you're using ASCII filenames anyway; if you're not, you really should.

* `metadata.py` treats each codec separately, and the list of supported codecs is far from complete. If you encounter an audio/video/subtitle codec that triggers stupid output, please report an issue or open a pull request. **If it's not a commonly seen codec, please link to a sample video with the relevant codec (cut it short with FFmpeg if possible) so that I can inspect and test.**

* `ffprobe` might report the wrong duration for certain VOB or other videos, which screws up the whole thing. See [#3](https://github.com/zmwangx/storyboard/issues/3). As a fallback, you can use the optional parameter `video_duration` to `storyboard.storyboard.StoryBoard` or `storyboard.metadata.Video` (see source files for extensive API doc).
