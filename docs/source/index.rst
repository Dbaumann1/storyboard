``storyboard`` is a `FFmpeg <https://ffmpeg.org/>`_-based customizable
video storyboard generator with metadata reporting directly embedded
in the generated images. Reported metadata fields include, but are not
limited to, title, filename, file size, SHA-1 digest, container
format, duration, pixel dimension, display aspect ratio (DAR), scan
type (progressive, interlaced, or telecined), frame rate, and
per-stream metadata (type, codec, profile, dimensions, bitrate, etc.).

Background
----------

``storyboard`` was inspired by the storyboards I frequently encounter
on video-sharing Internet forums, mostly generated by proprietary
video players. Those storyboards often come with video/file metadata
bundled, which I see as a great all-in-one solution for video sharing,
saving one the labor of typing multiple console commands, copying and
pasting output, and worrying about the forum's crappy
formatting. However, I, for one, dislike proprietary players. Also,
those storyboards are usually ugly and uninformative, using stupid
fonts and lacking crucial information that hackers look for (e.g.,
hash). Therefore, I developed this customizable storyboard generator
for hackers.
